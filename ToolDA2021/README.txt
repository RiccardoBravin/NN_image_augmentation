in the ExampleDataAugmentationApproaches.m
we use the dataset (DatasColor_38.mat) stored in that github file

For training CNN we have used Matlab official toolbox:
https://it.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/pretrained-convolutional-neural-networks.html

for dataAugCqt  and dataAugDwt you could modify the noise to modify the images (2° method of those approaches), 
using the parameters that we have used in many datasets the 2° method (of the three methods of those approches)
obtains images very similar to the original image
